Dominating the Data Flow

Flow: The Data Alchemist


Chapter 2 – “Frozen Schema”


After restoring a corrupted NiFi flow in the Data Grid, Shin receives a mysterious signal from deep within the Data Lake. The source? A long-forgotten artifact known as Apache Iceberg — a scalable data table system sealed away because it defied conventional schema laws.

New Key Concepts (Apache Iceberg)
Iceberg Tables = Massive crystalline structures in the frozen region of the Data Lake. They store evolving schemas without breaking.

Snapshots = Time-based reflections of past queries, allowing users to travel back to previous states of data.

Partition Fields = Shards of memory that split Iceberg Tables across dimensions for faster access.

Metadata Tree = A glowing holographic tree at the heart of every Iceberg table, holding its versioned structure.

Schema Evolution = A forbidden ability to alter data structure mid-battle — only Iceberg Masters can do it safely.


Shin enters a new sector of The Grid: a sub-zero environment of floating, crystalline data shards. He encounters Kira Frost, a mysterious girl in a flowing data-cloak, who guards the Frozen Schema Temple. She warns him: “No one survives touching the Metadata Tree unaligned.”

To prove himself, Shin is challenged to execute a query against an ancient Iceberg table with missing fields. He synchronizes NiFi with Iceberg by channeling a RecordReader/Writer combo, causing the crystals to spin. Binary ice storms begin to swirl.

Shin activates Schema Evolution mid-flow, allowing a table to accept a new column without version failure. Kira is shocked — even masters fail at live schema mutation. A flashback hints that Shin might be connected to Iceberg’s Original Committer.

“You’ve rewritten what was frozen. The Data War is bigger than NiFi. Welcome to the Iceberg Protocol.”
